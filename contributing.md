# How to Contribute

First, thank you for your interest!

Here are some tips that can help you set up your own test environment.

* Pull the code and start your branch somewhere your browser can load.  
* Update manifest.json and change the version number (to something higher). This will prevent you from making submissions while you test things.  
* If developing on Chrome use chrome://extensions and put yourself in developer mode. Then you can disable the real MHCT extension and load your branch using "Load unpacked".  
* You will need to use that button every time you want to test new changes.  
* Use the console (inspection tools, et al) in your browser to look at the payload. When it looks right, you're ready!

Most/All of the developers hang out on the [Mousehunt Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/Ya9zEdk) in #community-tools (you have to set a rank to see it).
